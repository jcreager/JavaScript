# JavaScript is Everywhere

I use JavaScript quite a bit and I have used it for quite a while.  However, these days I find myself gravitating towards alternatives like ClojureScript, TypeScript, and even Elm.  Most JavaScript development I do is for Node.js.  I have developed Node.js applications for Nike, Ubiquiti, and Compli.
